I am a quantitative researcher specializing in complex systems and network analysis applied to finance and economics. With a Ph.D. in statistical physics from POSTECH, I bring methodological expertise in analyzing the structure and dynamics of interconnected systems.

My work spans market microstructure, systemic risk analysis, and economic networks. I have applied these methods at Korea Exchange (derivatives markets, stress testing, market surveillance) and currently at the Bank of Korea (corporate loan networks, supply chain risks, financial market monitoring).

My research interests include complex systems, computational finance, machine learning in finance, and data-driven economic research.
