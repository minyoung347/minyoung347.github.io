I am a quantitative researcher working at the intersection of complex systems, economics, and finance. With a Ph.D. in statistical physics from POSTECH and experience at Korea Exchange, I currently work at the Bank of Korea. My research interests include complex systems, network analysis, and computational finance, with applications of machine learning to economics and finance.
