I am a quantitative researcher at the Bank of Korea with a Ph.D. in statistical physics from POSTECH. My work focuses on analyzing financial markets and economic systems through complex systems and network approaches.

My research interests include complex systems, computational finance, machine learning in finance, and data-driven economic research.
